# Contributing Guidelines #
1. Although this is a public open-source project, only approved members of Vets Who Code are allowed to contribute.
If you're not a member, you can still view, clone & fork the repo to do what you like with it.
2. if you are a memnber of Vets Who Code and would like to contribute, please contact me on our Slack channel and I'll add you as a collaborator
3. Once added, we'll discuss any feature you might want to work on, which can be selected from the project's kanban board.
Only cards that have been converted to issues should be selected.
4. Contributer commits are required to be verified. Please follow Github's instructions on how to set up your Github account and 
local Git environment to sign your commits with a GPG key.
5. Contributer commits should use a git commit template, provided by the project admin, to ensure meaningful commit messages.
6. While working on the project, please create a local branch based on what's currently in the 'develop' branch, and when you've completed work on your feature,
push the branch up and submit a pull request. PRs should have a clean history, so, after your work has been reviewed and approved,
please clean up the history of your branch so that only one commit with a meaningful commit message is present,
and no merge conflicts exist.
7. I want to keep TDD alive on this project, but I'm no nazi about it. Test what makes sense (Jest unit tests and Storybook UI tests where necessary).
8. PRs require approval from the admin before being merged.
9. PRs should ONLY be merged to devlop branch. Only tagged milestone releases should be merged to master.
